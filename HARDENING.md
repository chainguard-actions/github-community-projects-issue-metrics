Action **github-community-projects--issue-metrics/v4.2.7** was hardened automatically. 1 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The action.yml references a Docker image using a mutable tag (`v4`) instead of an immutable SHA digest. This means the image pulled at runtime could change without notice, enabling supply-chain attacks. The failing reference is: `image: "docker://ghcr.io/github-community-projects/issue_metrics:v4"`. It should be pinned to a specific SHA digest, e.g. `image: "docker://ghcr.io/github-community-projects/issue_metrics@sha256:<64-hex-char-digest>"`.

Locations:

- `action.yml:7`

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** unpinned-uses

**Notes:**

Replaced the mutable Docker image tag `ghcr.io/github-community-projects/issue_metrics:v4` with the immutable SHA digest `ghcr.io/github-community-projects/issue_metrics@sha256:0a3825e9a0af5404b1e28885d48b77eb7f0e0ccbff20ec599db66d616d394119` in action.yml line 7. The original tag `v4` is preserved as a comment outside the YAML string for readability.
